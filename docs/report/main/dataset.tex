\section{Dataset}

The MNIST dataset is a large dataset of handwritten digits, thus including ten mutually exclusive classes. It was creates from the samples of the NIST dataset; the originally black and white images were normalized to fit 28x28 pixels images and anti-alisiasing were used, which introduced grayscale levels, so that the pixel values are in the range [0, 255].

The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images (divided in two sets, train and validation, with 55,000 and 5,000 images resprectively) and 10,000 testing images.

For this project, from each sample the mean image of the dataset were subtracted.
